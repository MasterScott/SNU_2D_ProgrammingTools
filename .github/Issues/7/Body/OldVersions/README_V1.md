I just checked today, and unfortunately, there are 9 more versions of Blockly that need to be added after the current 9. Since it has already taken me multiple days to add in 4 versions, it is probably going to take at least an extra week to import support for the latest 9 versions of Blockly. I am going to hold this off until I am ready.
