### About

M3V7A1.0.2J12_2020 (Milestone 3 Version 7 Alpha 1.0.2 - June 12th 2020 build) is the 3rd GitHub release of the SNU programming tools module, with a couple changes. In this update, I:

> * Added support for `COBOL`
> * Removed all unneccessary `IGNORE.md` files (the ones that were used to create directories, but are no longer needed, but not the ones that tie the project together, such as directories that currently only have the `IGNORE.md` file in them) this change cut several Kilobytes off the version, but more noticeably cut off over 100 files from the version, which is a more noticeable change compared to the Kilobytes that were removed

Not much was changed, but I just wanted to put this update out. I am looking for more languages to add, COBOL seemed like a good one today.
