## M3V7 Alpha 1.0.3.1

### About

This is part of many new releases to the programming tools repositories where I add pre-existing support for Blockly. There is so much of it, and it is going to take some time to upload. I also plan to try and add CAML support as well in the finalized 1.0.3 build. It is going to take me some time to fully implement Blockly support.
