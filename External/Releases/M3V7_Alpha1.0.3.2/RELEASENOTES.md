# M3V7 Alpha 1.0.3.2 June 15th 2020 build

## M3V7 Alpha 1.0.3.2

### About

This is part of many new releases to the programming tools repositories where I add pre-existing support for Blockly. There is so much of it, and it is going to take some time to upload. I also plan to try and add CAML support as well in the finalized 1.0.3 build. It is going to take me some time to fully implement Blockly support.

In this version, I removed all the `IGNORE.md` files from the last version, and added further Blockly support.
