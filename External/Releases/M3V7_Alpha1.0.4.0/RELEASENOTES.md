# M3V7 Alpha 1.0.4.0 - August 14th 2020 build

## M3V7 Alpha 1.0.4.0

### About

This release took me a while to make, I have been procrastinating a bit. I thought it was going to be tedious to work with (just the homepages for 4 programming languages part) but just like the majority of things I think may be tedious, it has actually been quite fun developing this update. I was originally supposed to release this on August 6th 2020, but there were delays.

Some prominent features were added to this version, including a GitHub/+GistHub mode, along with support for 9 new programming languages.

In this release, I:

> * Added GitHub mode (github.com)

> * Added GistHub mode (gist.github.com)

> * Added support for 5 dialects of BASIC (Dartmouth BASIC, MSX BASIC, MS QuickBasic, Object-Oriented-BASIC, and Unstructured BASIC)

> * Increased support for ASP.NET

> * Added support for the lisp dialect, Scheme

> * Added support for Visual Basic .NET

> * Added support for SXML (Scheme + XML)

> * Created a homepage for 4 languages (Scheme, VB.NET, SXML, and BASIC)

I am pausing blockly imports for a while. This release is now finalized.
